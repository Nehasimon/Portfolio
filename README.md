## Solution
The project developed a stroke prediction model using logistic regression analysis in R.  This model leverages patient data to estimate an individual's risk of stroke.

## Approach
+ **Exploratory Data Analysis:** R was employed to explore the medical dataset, understand the distribution of features, and identify potential relationships between variables and stroke risk.
+ **Feature Engineering:** Based on the EDA, relevant features were selected and potentially transformed to improve model performance.
+ **Model Building and Evaluation:** Logistic regression models were built using R. Model selection techniques and hyperparameter tuning were implemented to optimize performance.
+ **Feature Importance:** Correlation analysis helped identify the most influential features for predicting stroke risk.
+ **Model Validation:** The model's performance was evaluated on unseen data to ensure generalizability.
